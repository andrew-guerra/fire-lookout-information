Tower names are as shown on official West Virginia state and U.S. government maps and other publications, or as listed by the various West Virginia state and U.S. government agencies (state conservation, environmental, forestry and transportation departments, NPS, USFS, etc.). Unconfirmed tower names were taken from unofficial sources (local names, unofficial maps, etc.) or have been assigned by Stafford (until name confirmation or further data is received)., Key: Green = Standing Red = Removed Yellow = Incomplete information (that which is unconfirmed and will be updated as the correct data becomes available). MDDNR (state) = Maryland Department of Natural Resources PRIVATE = Privately Owned USFS = U.S. Forest Service (U.S. Department of Agriculture) WVCC (state) = West Virginia Conservation Commission (1933-1961) WVDF (state) = West Virginia Division of Forestry (1961-present) WVDNR (state) = West Virginia Department of Natural Resources (1961-1983?) WVDNR (state) = West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (19xx-) WVFGFD (state) = West Virginia Forest, Game and Fish Department (1909-1921) WVGFC (state) = West Virginia Game and Fish Commission (1921-1929) WVGFFC (state) = West Virginia Game, Fish and Forestry Commission (1929-1933),
