Notes: Research by Mark Haughwout and Peter Hayes The map locations are approximate Information on individual towers will be posted as information is found. In the 1921 commisioners report it lists these towers locations - Westmore, Stone, Belvidere, Owlshead, Spruce, Camels Hump, Ascutney, Okemo, Dorset, Haystack, Bald and Stratton. It also lists these lookouts that are not owned or run by the state - Sable, Gore West Pond, Burke, Cushman, and Pico. In the 1941 report, it does not list the lookout names only to say that there are 24 state run lookouts in opperation.,
