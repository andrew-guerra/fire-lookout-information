Tower names are as shown on official South Carolina state and U.S. government maps and other publications, or as listed by the various South Carolina state and U.S. government agencies (state conservation, environmental, forestry and transportation departments, NPS, USFS, etc.). Unconfirmed tower names were taken from unofficial sources (local names, unofficial maps, etc.) or have been assigned by Stafford (until name confirmation or further data is received)., Key: Green = Standing Red = Removed Yellow = Incomplete information (that which is unconfirmed and will be updated as the correct data becomes available).
